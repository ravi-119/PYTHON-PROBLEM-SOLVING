# write a program to Calculating the Power of a Number

# Taking base value as a input from user
base = int(input("Enter base value: "))
# Taking exponent value as a input from user
exponent = int(input("Enter exponent: "))
# storing the result in a result variable
result = base ** exponent
# Printing the result
print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is : ",result)
