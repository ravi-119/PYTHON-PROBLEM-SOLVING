# Python Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains Python solutions to a variety of problems, organized into different categories. Below is a brief overview of the directory structure:

## Directory Structure

-   **PS-Sprint-1**: Contains solutions to problems from the first sprint, focusing on basic algorithms and data structures.
-   **PS-Sprint-2**: Contains solutions to problems from the second sprint, building upon the concepts from the first sprint with more complex challenges.
-   **PSTMID2**: Contains solutions to problems related to number theory and mathematical concepts.
-   **MID2**: Contains solutions to problems for the mid-term exams.

Each directory contains individual Python files (`.py`) that address specific problems. The filenames are generally descriptive of the problem they solve.

## Contents

### PS-Sprint-1

This directory includes solutions to problems covering fundamental concepts such as:

-   Basic data structures (arrays, strings)
-   Basic algorithms (sorting, searching)
-   Mathematical problems (prime numbers, Fibonacci sequence)
-   String manipulation
-   Pattern generation

### PS-Sprint-2

This directory contains solutions to more advanced problems, including:

-   Working with ranges and series
-   Finding patterns in data
-   Advanced mathematical problems

### PSTMID2

This directory focuses on mathematical problems, including:

-   Number theory problems (perfect numbers, amicable numbers, strong numbers)
-   Divisibility and factors

### MID2

This directory contains solutions specifically prepared for mid-term exams, covering a range of topics similar to those in the sprint directories.

## Usage

Each Python file is a standalone solution to a specific problem. You can run these files using a Python interpreter. For example:

```bash
python c:\Users\RAVI\Desktop\150 Problems\PYTHON-PROBLEM-SOLVING\PS-Sprint-1\Finding the Sum of Elements in an Array.py
```

Replace the file path with the path to the specific problem you want to run.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a better solution to an existing problem or want to add a solution to a new problem, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your changes.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.
4.  Submit a pull request.

Please ensure your code is well-documented and follows Python coding conventions (PEP 8).
